Understanding the mechanisms behind human mobility patterns is crucial to improve our ability to predict the spread of infectious diseases.
Two representative mobility models, i.e., radiation and modified gravity models, have been extensively compared to each other against various
empirical data sets,while their fundamental relation is far from being fully understood.In order to study such a relation, we first model the 
heterogeneous population landscape by generating a fractal geometry of sites and then by assigning to each site a population independently
drawn from a power-law distribution. Then the radiation model on this population landscape,which we call the radiation-on-landscape (RoL) model, 
is compared to the modified gravity model to understand how the distance exponent in the modified gravity model is vary according to properties
of the population landscape, furthermore it confirmed by the numerical simulations. Moreover, 
the radiation model and multi-patch SIR model are used to study how human mobility impacts the spread of
infectious diseases.
